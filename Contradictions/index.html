Contradictions :

A child working in provisional store is called child-labor and it is a crime. But a child working in a movie is called child-star and it is allowed(I don't know why, may be the child acting in movie may not get paid).

 Conducting Jallikattu is banned(Or in discussion to ban) because it is killing/giving pain to animals. But eating meats are allowed(I don't how they are getting meats without killing/giving pain to an animal).

People are asking for Jallikattu mentioning it's happening from a long time ago which we can't give up . But same people are asking to change the reservation system which is also happening for a long time.  (I don't know about these people mindset). If change is required then change is required in both. Instead of removing or banning we can change the rules in both.

 Smoking/Drinking alcohol in public is a crime and it is bad for health(Intention is to care citizens). But government can sell the same alcohol to same citizens(Intention is to get more money to care the same citizens).

People believe in God that he can take our soul at any time. Same people believe in doctors who try to save humans from death when god also tries to take it.

When we pray it is a god. When it is stolen we say it is statue .</body><html>
